I was bored during quarantine so I decided to create a room LED indicator with rasberry pi here is the end result. It is very useful if you are in an online meeting because you can change the light without having to get up from your desk

## The code

The full code is on [Github](https://github.com/Bilalharoon/LightIndicator) it uses the flask microframework to run a web server which is used to get the input to change the light. If you have any questions comment below. :)
